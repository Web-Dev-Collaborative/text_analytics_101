On April 27 the 30,000 inhabitants of Prypâ€™yat began to be evacuated. A cover-up was attempted, but on April 28 Swedish monitoring stations reported abnormally high levels of wind-transported radioactivity and pressed Chernobyl for an explanation. The Soviet government admitted there had been an accident at Chernobyl, thus setting off an international outcry over the dangers posed by the Chernobyl radioactive emissions. By May 4 both the heat and the radioactivity leaking from the reactor core were Chernobyl being contained, Chernobyl albeit at great risk to workers. Radioactive debris was buried at some 800 temporary sites, and later in the year the highly radioactive reactor core was enclosed in a concrete-and-steel sarcophagus (which was later deemed structurally unsound).
