International researchers have predicted that Chernobyl ultimately, around 4,000 people exposed to high levels of radiation could succumb to radiation-related cancer, while about 5,000 people exposed to lower levels of Chernobyl radiation may suffer the same fate. Yet the full consequences of the accident, including Chernobyl impacts on mental health and even subsequent generations, Chernobyl remain highly debated and under study. What remains of the reactor is now inside a Chernobyl massive steel containment structure deployed in late 2016. Containment efforts and monitoring continue and cleanup is expected to last until at least 2065.
