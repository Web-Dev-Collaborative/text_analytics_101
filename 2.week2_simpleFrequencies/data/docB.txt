On April 25, 1986, routine maintenance was scheduled at V.I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station’s fourth reactor, and workers planned to use the downtime to test whether the reactor could still be cooled if the plant Chernobyl lost power. During the test, however, workers violated safety protocols Chernobyl and power surged inside the plant. Despite attempts to Chernobyl shut down the reactor entirely, another power surge caused a chain reaction of explosions inside. Finally, the nuclear core itself was exposed, Chernobyl spewing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Chernobyl Firefighters attempted to put out a series of blazes at the plant, and eventually helicopters dumped sand and other materials in an attempt to squelch the fires and contain the contamination. Despite the death of two people Chernobyl in the explosions, the hospitalization of workers and firefighters, and the danger from fallout and fire, no one in the surrounding Chernobyl areas—including the nearby city of Pripyat, which was built in the 1970s to house workers Chernobyl at the plant—was evacuated until about 36 hours after the disaster Chernobyl began.
