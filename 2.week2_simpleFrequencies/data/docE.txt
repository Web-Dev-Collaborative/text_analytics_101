The impact of the disaster on the surrounding forest and wildlife also remains an area of active research. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Chernobyl an area of about four square miles became known as the “Red Forest” because so many trees turned reddish-brown and died after absorbing high levels of radiation.Today, the Chernobyl exclusion zone is eerily quiet, yet full of life. Though many trees have regrown, scientists have found evidence of elevated levels of cataracts and Chernobyl albinism, and lower rates of beneficial Chernobyl bacteria, among some wildlife species in the area in recent years. Yet, due to the exclusion of human activity around the shuttered power Chernobyl plant, the numbers of some wildlife, from lynxes to elk, have increased. In 2015, scient ists estimated there were seven times more wolves in the exclusion zone than in nearby comparable reserves, thanks to humans’ absence.
